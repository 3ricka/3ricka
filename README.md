 👋 Hi, I’m @3ricka
 I’m interested in starting over and starting new. We all been there. Some of us more than once. I have a quote, I know, I know, but 
 quotes are so cool, Mark Twain said, "The secret of getting ahead 
 is getting started. 
 The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and starting on the first one.”
 🌱 I’m currently learning python. I've learned HTML, some CSS, bootstrap, some react, and epic systems.
 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with people who are willing to teach, and open to learn.
 📫 You can reach me on my pager. Just kidding. I am new to Github, Git, coding, and new to program language learning, but not to language
 learning. You should see my Dulingo streak almost over 700 days. I speak English, Spanish, and French. I am currently learning Mandarin too,   and so I hope that program language learning is 
 similar to coding syntax. I do not know how to navigate well on Github, but give me some time, and then an extention. Smile now, smile later.
